# Bike_Store_Analysis
Hello folks,
This is the analysis of a Bike Store using SQL.

I have analyzed the data of a bike store and answered 15 business questions which can be found in the 'Questions.txt' file in this repository. I did this analysis as a personal project on my journey of learning Data Analysis. This project is solely based on SQL. The database system that I used is PostgreSQL.
I acquired the dataset for this project from 'kaggle.com'. The link to the data set is down below and also I've uploaded the dataset which is in 9 different CSV files in this repository.

This project boosted my confidence working in SQL and enhanced my knowledge. It was a great opportunity to practice the knowledge I have been gaining in my data analytics journey. It was fun overall working on this project.

I will be glad if my project helps anyone with their data analytics journey.

Thank You!
